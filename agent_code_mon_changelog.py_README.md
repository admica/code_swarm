# Code Monitoring Agent README

## Overview

This is a code monitoring agent that tracks changes to Python files and generates changelogs. It uses Git events to monitor file modifications, performs syntax checking, style consistency analysis, and AI-driven analysis using a large language model (LLM) service.

## Key Features and Functionality

* Tracks changes to Python files
* Generates changelogs for modified files
* Performs syntax checking using Pylint
* Analyzes style consistency with other Python files in the project
* Uses AI LLM service for advanced analysis of code changes
* Handles file modification events from Git

## Notable Implementation Details

* The agent uses a modular design, separating configuration management, code analysis, and AI-driven analysis into distinct classes.
* The `ConfigManager` class is responsible for loading and validating configuration files, while the `CodeAnalyzer` class performs syntax checking, style consistency analysis, and changelog updates.

## Usage

To use this module, simply run the `main` function to start the agent. You can configure the agent by creating a configuration file or using the default configuration provided by the `create_default_config` function.

Note: This README is focused on providing an overview of the module's purpose and functionality. For detailed implementation information, please refer to the individual class and function documentation.


## Classes

### `ConfigManager`

Manages configuration loading and validation for the agent.

#### Methods

- `__init__(config_path)`: Initialize the config manager.
- `load_config()`: Load configuration from config.
- `create_default_config()`: Create default configuration file.
- `get_config()`: Get configuration dictionary.

### `CodeAnalyzer`

Analyzes Python code changes and maintains changelogs.

#### Methods

- `__init__(repo_path, config)`: Initialize the code analyzer.
- `get_file_from_git(file_path)`: Get the last committed version of the file from Git.
- `calculate_syntax_score(content)`: Check if the Python code has valid syntax.
- `run_pylint_analysis(content)`: Run Pylint analysis on the code.
- `calculate_style_consistency(file_path, content)`: Compare style with other Python files in the project.
- `calculate_complexity_score(old_content, new_content)`: Calculate complexity of changes.
- `get_ai_analysis(old_content, new_content)`: Get AI analysis of changes using the controller's LLM service.
- `update_changelog(file_path, changes_description)`: Update the changelog file specific to the modified Python file.

### `PyFileHandler`

Handles Python file modification events.

#### Methods

- `__init__(analyzer)`: Initialize the file handler.
