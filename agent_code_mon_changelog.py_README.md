# Code Monitoring Agent for Python Files

This module is a code monitoring agent designed to track changes to Python files and generate changelogs. It provides a comprehensive solution for developers who want to maintain a record of code modifications, ensuring that their projects are well-documented and easily trackable.

## Key Features and Functionality:

*   Tracks changes to Python files
*   Generates changelogs based on code modifications
*   Analyzes Python code syntax using Pylint
*   Evaluates style consistency with other Python files in the project
*   Calculates complexity of changes
*   Utilizes AI analysis for further insights

## Notable Implementation Details:

*   The agent is built around three main classes: `ConfigManager`, `CodeAnalyzer`, and `PyFileHandler`. Each class plays a crucial role in managing configuration, analyzing code changes, and handling file modification events.
*   The `main` function serves as the entry point for the agent, orchestrating the entire process from configuration loading to changelog generation.

## README Usage:

To use this module effectively, follow these steps:

1.  Install required dependencies
2.  Configure the agent using the provided configuration file
3.  Run the main function to start monitoring Python files

By utilizing this code monitoring agent, developers can streamline their development process, maintain accurate records of code modifications, and leverage advanced analytics for improved project management.


## Classes

### `ConfigManager`

Manages configuration loading and validation for the agent.

#### Methods

- `__init__(config_path)`: Initialize the config manager.
- `load_config()`: Load configuration from config.
- `create_default_config()`: Create default configuration file.
- `get_config()`: Get configuration dictionary.

### `CodeAnalyzer`

Analyzes Python code changes and maintains changelogs.

#### Methods

- `__init__(repo_path, config)`: Initialize the code analyzer.
- `get_file_from_git(file_path)`: Get the last committed version of the file from Git.
- `calculate_syntax_score(content)`: Check if the Python code has valid syntax.
- `run_pylint_analysis(content)`: Run Pylint analysis on the code.
- `calculate_style_consistency(file_path, content)`: Compare style with other Python files in the project.
- `calculate_complexity_score(old_content, new_content)`: Calculate complexity of changes.
- `get_ai_analysis(old_content, new_content)`: Get AI analysis of changes using the controller's LLM service.
- `update_changelog(file_path, changes_description)`: Update the changelog file specific to the modified Python file.

### `PyFileHandler`

Handles Python file modification events.

#### Methods

- `__init__(analyzer)`: Initialize the file handler.
- `on_modified(event)`: Handle file modification events.
