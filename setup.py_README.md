## Overview

This is a setup script for Code Swarm, a development environment management tool. The script automates the installation of required dependencies to get started with Code Swarm.

## Key Features and Functionality

* Checks and installs npm (Node Package Manager) if not already installed
* Installs frontend dependencies necessary for Code Swarm's functionality
* Verifies Python version meets requirements using `check_python_version`

## Notable Implementation Details

* The script uses a modular approach, with each function handling specific tasks (e.g., installing dependencies or checking package versions)
* No classes are used in this module, making it simple and focused on its core purpose
* The script assumes a Unix-like environment and may require modifications for Windows or other operating systems

## Usage and Installation

To use this setup script, simply run the `main` function, which will guide you through the installation process. This script is intended to be run once, during initial setup, and does not require any manual configuration.

Note: This script can be modified or extended as needed to accommodate specific Code Swarm requirements or dependencies.
